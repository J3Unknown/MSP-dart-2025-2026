## Problem 1

Rules of the "rock, paper, scissors" game are:

Return only String of the result.

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper,
Paper beats Rock.
Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Example

```
"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"
```

## Problem 2

Return only the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` as vowels.

The input string will consist of lower & upper case letters and/or spaces.

> **Note** : if the string consist with spaces print number of spaces , if not print "No Spaces In The String".

Example (only return `integer`& use `print()` for spaces)

```
"abcdEf" -> 2
"No Spaces In The String"
"Computer science " -> 6
2 spaces
"Moon Light" -> 3
1 space
```

## Problem 3 (optional)

Count the number of Duplicates.

Return only the count of duplicates.

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string.

The input string can be assumed to contain alphabets uppercase & lowercase and numeric digits and/or spaces.

> **Note** : you should ignore the spaces.

Example

```
"abc de" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aab bcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility  " -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA 11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
```
